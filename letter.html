        <h2>LETTER TO YOU‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
        <P id="letter">  
        When I met you, I had no idea about   just how
        much my life was about to be changed but then
        how could I have known? </br>
        </P>
        A love like ours happens once in a lifetime even if youre not going to admit that you love me (like duhüòåüíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). You're
        a godsent(someone who nunderstands me and makes my feelings count). To me, you're just everything I have ever hoped for, the one I thought would only exist in my imagination after plenty of shege lol. When you came into my life, I realised that what I had always thought was happiness couldn't be compared to the joy loving you
        brought me. </p>
        You are a part of everything I think
        and do and feel, and with you by my side, I
        believe there's not a single thing in the would that we can't accomplish.Like i'd always say "with you by my side, the world is ours to take". It's because of you that I laugh, smile and have the sweetest dreams at
        night (Even with the action movies i act in my sleep). </p>
        Thank you for the miracle of you,You're one of      many miracles to come. You are,
        and always will be, the love of my life.
        I'll love you without reservation, cherish you and
        hold you in the highest regard. I will support you
        and comfort you through life's joys and sorrows.
        I'll encourage you, inspire you and be honest and
        faithful to you. I'll stand by your side even when
        no one is standing with you, in sickness and in
        health baby. </p>
        And because of this,I pray that May your life be
        full of happiness, laughter and love like you brought into my life! </p>
        Yours forever</br>
        Jobi
